# PythonAncientLanguages

This Open Source project hopes to create a viable method to detect, recognize and interpret ancient written languages as Egyptian Hieroglyphics and Sumerian Cuneiform. The method intended is Deep Learning with Convolutional layers using Tensorflow 2.x with the Keras API.

Just like many other projects this is not without precedent. I first became aware of using Machine Learning to translate Hieroglyphs by reading the Master Thesis of Morris Franken (University of Amsterdam). Since that time the author has expanded on his work and created a Keras based version. The code base [GitHub](https://github.com/morrisfranken/glyphreader) and his master thesis are in my opinion the best way to get started in this field. However, his work was hampered by the severely limited dataset available.

Since late 2017 there is also the Hieroglyphics Initiative from game publisher Ubisoft. This coincided with the release of Assassin's Creed Origins. Only recently did this intiative release a Desktop app (July 2020). However, little of the project has been made public and neither is the dataset available.

## Project Goals
- Update the work of Morris Franken to 2020 Deep Learning standards
- Create a detector, recognition and interpration model
- Create an Android app that can be used during a museum visit

This work does not have to be perfect, it is intended to be the best available publicly.

## Short-term goals
- Create a hieroglyphic detector model using the Pyramid of Unas dataset
- Create an Android app that can use the hieroglyphic detector model
- Attempt to find new datasets
